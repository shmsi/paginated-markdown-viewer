# Getting Started with Markdown Books

Welcome to your new Markdown Book! This file is a sample to demonstrate how to create markdown content for your book.

## What is a Markdown Book?

A Markdown Book is a collection of markdown files that are automatically rendered as a beautiful interactive book. Each file becomes a page in your book, complete with:

- Table of contents
- Page navigation
- Beautiful typography
- Code syntax highlighting
- Dark/light mode

## Creating Your Content

To create your book, simply write your content in markdown files named with sequential numbers:

- `1.md` (this file)
- `2.md`
- `3.md`
- And so on...

Each file should start with a level 1 heading (`# Title`) which will be used as the chapter title in the table of contents.

## Markdown Formatting

You can use all standard markdown syntax:

### Text Formatting

- **Bold text** with `**bold**`
- *Italic text* with `*italic*`
- ~~Strikethrough~~ with `~~strikethrough~~`
- [Links](https://example.com) with `[text](url)`

### Lists

Ordered lists:

1. First item
2. Second item
3. Third item

Unordered lists:

- Apples
- Oranges
- Bananas

### Code Blocks

Inline code: `const greeting = 'Hello World';`

Code blocks with syntax highlighting:

```javascript
function calculateSum(a, b) {
  return a + b;
}

const result = calculateSum(5, 10);
console.log(`The sum is ${result}`);
```

### Blockquotes

> This is a blockquote.
> 
> It can span multiple lines.

### Special Callouts

You can create special callout blocks:

<div class="note">
This is an important note!
</div>

<div class="warning">
Warning! Be careful about this.
</div>

<div class="tip">
Here's a helpful tip to make things easier.
</div>

## Images

You can include images (if they're in the same directory):

| Name     | Type    | Description       |
|----------|---------|-------------------|
| id       | integer | Unique identifier |
| title    | string  | Item title        |
